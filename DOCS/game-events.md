Game Events are situations that need to be resolved. After each turn, there is a possibility a player will need to handle an event. Handling an event can mean simply acknowledging that something happened, or taking action via options on the screen to affect the resolution.

`advanceDay` is responsible for gathering game events and returning game data with the events that should occur at the end of a turn from the main screen. If there are events, the main screen should then switch to the events screen.
